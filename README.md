# challenge2VBA: The VBA of Wall Street


## Summarizing stock market data using VBA Scripts

For this Challenge, I followed the instructions provided to calculate each Stock Tickers performance over the course of each year that data was provided for (2018, 2019, 2020).

Not only was I able to utilize VBA to calculate the Yearly Change, Percent Change and Total Stock Volume over the course of each year, I also used the script to conditionally format the values for Yearly Change and Percent Change, so that a user can easily discern whether a stock's value increased or decreased over the given year.

Further analysis is offered in the form of a small table that provides the ticker which experienced each of the following:
1. Greatest % Increase
2. Greatest % Decrease
3. Greatest Total Volume

This further allows the user to quickly assess some of the outliers within each year's dataset.
